      title: 'How To Make Sense Of Your Form W-2 This Tax Season',
      text:
          'Chances are that when you get your paycheck, you don’t look closely at anything beyond the net pay—the amount deposited into your account. But your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement? That’s a different story. Tax season is the first—and often only—time during the year that many taxpayers seriously consider how much money is taken out of their paychecks.(Admit it: the total tax withheld always gives you a jolt.)The amount of information on Form W-2 can be overwhelming. But whether you’re importing the numbers from your W-2 directly into a tax software program (including IRS’ Free File or Direct File programs) or simply handing the form over to your tax professional, it wise to take a few minutes to actually look at your W-2—both to spot possible errors and to understand how taxes (and employee benefits) affect your finances.Here\'s a look at what you need to know about your Form W-2 for the current tax season.Employees Only An employer will issue a Form W-2 to you if you are an employee. You’ll receive something different—Form 1099-NEC—if you’re an independent contractor.The form you receive at tax time should not be a surprise. If you receive a Form W-2, but thought you were an independent contractor, or if you receive a Form 1099-NEC, but thought you were an employee, you need to have a conversation with payroll immediately. Waiting and trying to resolve it after you’ve filed your tax returns will only make a bad situation worse.Reporting Criteri An employer must issue you a Form W-2 if you were paid at least \$600 in cash or cash equivalent during the year, including taxable benefits. It doesn’t matter how many hours you worked, or how long you were employed. It also doesn’t matter whether you were part-time or full-time, seasonal or permanent. If you are an employee and you’ve received at least \$600, your employer has a reporting obligation.There are two exceptions to the \$600 rule:If any taxes are withheld, including those for Social Security or Medicare (including the .9% additional Medicare tax for high-wage earners, sometimes referred to as the Medicare surcharge), your employer must issue you a Form W-2 no matter how much you were paid during the year.If you would have been subject to withholding if you had claimed no more than one withholding allowance or had not claimed exemption from withholding on Form W-4, your employee must issue you a Form W-2 no matter how much you were paid.Don\'t be alarmed if you were paid less than \$600—and didn\'t meet an exception—and still receive a Form W-2 this tax season. Sometimes, an employer will issue a Form W-2 to all employees because it\'s easier for them.Due Date Employers must furnish you a Form W-2 by Jan. 31, 2024. For purposes of the rule, your employer will meet the "furnish" requirement if it\'s appropriately addressed and mailed on or before the due date.It does\'t have to be mailed—a Form W-2 could end up in your email or portal. However, an employer may not send a Form W-2 electronically to any employee who does not consent to receive the form electronically or who has revoked consent.And if you left your job before year-end? Your former employer can turn over your Form W-2 any time after your employment ends, but no later than Jan. 31, 2024. If you specifically ask for it before that time, they must turn it over within 30 days of the request or within 30 days of the final wage payment, whichever is later. Copies Your employer is required to prepare several copies of Forms W-2. Three of those copies will be delivered to you:Copy B is used to report your federal income taxes and is generally filed with your federal income tax return unless you file electronically. In that case, you must provide your preparer with Copy B, but you don\'t typically need to forward it to IRS. Copy 2 is used to report your state, city, or local income tax and is filed with the relevant tax authorities. Copy C is for your records. Yes, it\'s a lot of paper. If you want less paper and your employer has an appropriate system, you can receive your forms electronically. To do this, you must expressly consent—again, your employer may not send Form W-2 electronically to any employee who doesn\'t agree or has revoked consent.Reporting Year Your Form W-2 must reflect wages paid during the calendar year. For example, if you worked from Dec. 18, 2023, through Jan. 3, 2024, and were paid on Dec. 25, 2023, and Jan. 10, 2024, respectively, you will receive two Forms W-2—one for the days you were paid in 2023 and one for the days you were paid in 2024.What about if you worked from Dec. 18, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2023, but were paid on Jan. 3, 2024? All of those wages will be reported on your 2024 Form W-2.'),

      title: 'Sustainable Success: A Framework for Optimizing Profit',
      text:
          'All management teams want to position their company to weather the ups and downs of a business cycle without compromising its ability to thrive. The key to that goal is optimizing profit targets. While all organizations generally apply some effort to profit-optimization initiatives, I’ve found that when those attempts fall short, it’s because they lack a strong framework for establishing the right targets or a strategy for executing on their goals. Establishing this kind of framework is all the more important when economic trends are gloomy. A potential recession can cast doubt on expected revenue growth and cash flows. Inflationary pressures push wages, material costs, and operating expenses upward, eroding profitability unless they’re swiftly countered with price increases or other offsetting levers. Higher interest rates tighten the screws further, negatively impacting return on invested capital, especially for businesses with unhedged floating-rate debt obligations.That doesn’t mean it\’s time to panic. Challenging times present an opportunity for leadership to head off financial distress by reviewing company processes, vendor agreements, product portfolios, pricing, and other factors to streamline operations and craft strategies that deliver optimal margins while enabling the business to achieve key objectives. Having resources allocated as efficiently as possible allows management to move quickly and confidently in the face of headwinds. And if a recession doesn’t materialize, or other trends improve, your company will be more advantageously positioned to take capitalize on new growth investments.In this article, I outline a four-step strategic process businesses can use to successfully define and implement profitability optimization initiatives in the face of steep inflation and high interest rates. I focus on EBITDA margins in order to eliminate the noncash impact of depreciation and amortization, which are less directly impacted by profitability initiatives.Step 1: Define Optimal Profitability and Establish Targets As Yogi Berra famously said, “You’ve got to be very careful if you don’t know where you are going because you might not get there.” Once you untangle this advice, it applies to all strategic planning. When dealing with profit optimization, it’s critical that management doesn’t engage in initiatives that deliver short-term improvements at the expense of long-term strategic objectives.Frequently, I\’ll see management teams set goals without knowing the true potential of their business. Traditionally, you’d analyze your historical data in order to estimate future profitability targets—however, that can shortchange your organization. In isolation, historical data can’t tell you everything about your business capabilities, especially as circumstances change, or whether your company’s previous performance is sustainable in the long term. If you only look at what you’ve done before, you could set a target that falls well short of—or worse, in excess of—what you can actually attain.For example, a company\’s management may see that the business averaged an EBITDA margin of 13% over the past three years. Partially due to external factors, margins have decreased to 9% this year. By establishing goals only on the basis of the historical data, management establishes the initiative of restoring EBITDA margins to 13%.While this approach may work to sustain the business, allow you to achieve prior profitability levels, or even reach new levels of profitability, it doesn’t define the true potential for EBITDA margins. Opportunities to achieve 15% or 17% margins might exist, but the company will never reach them if its leaders don’t understand what’s possible. Over time, these percentage points will become worth millions of dollars to stakeholders. Let’s examine what you should do instead of relying solely on historical data.Looking at the example below, we can see that the (creatively named) ABC Co.—a hypothetical HR and payroll software company—is currently enjoying EBITDA margins of 15% with a historical five-year average of 13.5%. But ABC Co.’s leadership should not assume it can rest on its laurels.',

          'Remote or On-site? The Real Cost of Office Space for a Venture-backed Startup',
      text:
          'Companies have been debating the merits of remote work since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those pointing out remote work’s downsides say it offers potentially fewer opportunities to build the cohesive teams and company culture necessary for innovation. Proponents of remote work like me note its clear benefits for employers as well as workers, including increased productivity, access to expanded talent pools, and substantial financial savings. In this article, I demonstrate how choosing to go remote not only reduces your startup’s overhead, but can preserve significant equity in the long run.I\’ve consulted on financial and growth strategies for hundreds of founders and startup CFOs around the world and have seen firsthand how the decision between an in-office and an all-remote model can make or break a business. While startups with an on-site work model typically do plan for the immediate costs of a physical office, they don\’t always look deeply enough into the implications. Spending additional dollars now to rent or build an office requires raising those additional dollars—and that means relinquishing more equity to investors when you exit.That exit may seem far off now, but as your company grows in value, the true cost of any given expense today extends well beyond its initial price tag. In this article, I present a simple, data-based framework for venture-funded companies to assess the full financial implications of building a remote company versus a company with a traditional physical footprint. You can apply this structure at every stage of the fundraising process to help you make fully informed decisions.Forecast Your Office Space Expense While every business is different, guides to starting an on-site business typically point to office space as one of the chief costs, after staff, and rightly so. The first step in deciding whether to build your company as an on-site or remote operation is to model the full impact of buying, leasing, or renting space.Anticipate Your Team Size To know how much office space you\’ll need, begin by estimating the size of your team over time. You should already have a specific hiring plan for at least the next 12 months, or, better yet, for the period covered by the funding round that you\’re raising money for or have recently completed (typically 18 to 24 months).Have each of your team leads provide their staffing requirements for the time frame you\’re working with, based on their different departmental targets. Your business development and sales lead can tell you how many deals each team member is expected to close per month and how many people would be needed to reach this target. Your technology lead can provide you with information such as the number of IT staffers required per 1,000 active users and the frequency and scale of new features launched, and so forth. These figures, in tandem with your company’s growth targets, will help you build a hiring plan that will allow you to achieve your objectives before your next funding round.Calculate Average Revenue per Team Member Next, anticipate how many people your company will need in the years immediately following this hiring plan for your first one to two years or whatever period you’re using. To do so, you divide your revenue targets by the average revenue per team member for startups by stage. Dividing your company\’s annual run rate (ARR) forecast by the ARR per full-time equivalent (FTE) in your industry allows you to predict the size of your team over the later years in your model. This step is analytically simple and grounds your assumptions in real data on revenue per person.Various sources offer data on the average revenue per team member companies should expect to generate at different stages of company growth in different sectors. For my example, I’ve used SaaS Capital\’s benchmark for ARR per FTE for 1,500 venture-funded SaaS companies as of 2022, but you should use whatever source works best for your industry.',

          'How to Build Your Startup’s Financial Model to Grab Investor Interest',
      text:
          'When it comes to financial modeling, presentation matters. A financial model is more than just a spreadsheet full of numbers; it’s a powerful tool that tells the story of your business, outlining its potential and demonstrating its viability. When you’re pitching to investors, your startup’s financial model can help you communicate your company’s value proposition, navigate negotiations, and secure the funding you need to grow.With venture capital now significantly more scarce than it was in 2021, a strong financial model is all the more important. According to Crunchbase, not even the rush to fund AI startups in the second quarter of 2023 was enough to pull global VC out of the doldrums. As a startup consultant, I aid my clients in M&A advisory, fundraising strategy, pitch presentations, financial modeling, valuation analysis, and more. I have witnessed firsthand the challenges startup founders face when they don\’t follow one simple rule: Consider your financial models from an investor\’s perspective. A bar chart showing time spent by VCs on various pitch deck sections. Financials is the second largest, at approximately 25 seconds. Money is key: After the fundraising ask, investors care most about a company\’s financials. With investors paying such close attention to a company\’s financials, you may be tempted—especially if you don\’t have a great deal of financial experience yourself—to turn to a professionally designed financial model template for startups. But I don\’t recommend this because, in most cases, a template isn\’t as plug-and-play as it seems. You could find yourself stuck with large blank areas that don’t apply to your company’s business model, or, even worse, parts of the model that you can’t use because you are unable to tweak the embedded formulas the way you need to. Although it\’s additional work on the front end, you\’ll get a more useful and professional-looking result if you start from scratch. In this article, I discuss how I have helped founders build a financial model with investors in mind—and how to use the model to create a persuasive pitch. Focus on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) In your financial modeling, it\’s important to strike the right balance between including enough information to provide a comprehensive picture of your startup\’s financial health, and not overwhelming investors with excessive detail. Zoom in on the most important metrics, known as key performance indicators (KPIs), which demonstrate your startup\’s progress and potential. This can seem obvious at the strategic level, but startup founders often get mired in detail. I once worked with a startup that had developed an innovative e-commerce platform. It was preparing to pitch to investors for its next funding round, and had built a financial model so overwhelmingly detailed that the primary KPIs were difficult to find. I helped the founders identify and prioritize their startup\’s most important KPIs and incorporated them into the financial model. Here’s how to approach getting the balance right: Understand Your Business and Industry Start by developing a deep understanding of your business model, your industry, and the factors that drive growth and profitability. This knowledge will help you pinpoint the specific metrics that investors are likely to focus on when evaluating your startup\’s potential. For example, a software as a service (SaaS) startup might prioritize metrics like monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), while a retail business might focus on metrics like average transaction value and inventory turnover. In the case of the e-commerce startup, we determined that metrics for customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, and monthly average users would need to be prominent.',

      title: '3 Trends Shaping the Future of Tech Venture Capital in Asia',
      text:
          'International venture capital in Asia has flourished over the last decade, led by ecosystem platforms (“super apps”), gaming, and e-commerce. Underpinned by a list of favorable factors like large populations, a rising middle class, and increasing technological adoption, the Asia-Pacific region has become an incredibly rich market for tech investors.By 2021, total startup deal value in the Asia-Pacific exceeded \$152 billion—matching the US total in 2018 and surpassing the boom of the dot-com era. Like much of the world, the area experienced a significant fundraising decline in 2022, but it’s also likely to weather the expected global downturn in 2023 better than anywhere else in the world. China, India, and Southeast Asia, in particular, are swiftly becoming some of the most attractive venture markets in the world. However, to make the most of their investment dollars in this culturally and economically diverse region, VCs must familiarize themselves with its nuances.As an investment consultant based in Hong Kong, I\’ve been actively involved in the private investment markets in the Asia-Pacific for the last decade. One thing I would emphasize to investors targeting Chinese, Indian, and Southeast Asian markets is that although they’re geographically connected and all considered “emerging markets,” the venture opportunities in each are distinctly different. That said, as regulatory environments change and M&A-happy tech giants provide increasing competition to VC, what happens in one country can have a significant effect on markets in others. Here are the trends that I see shaping the venture environment of these markets in the coming years.China: Tech Giants Are Supplanting VC To understand the state of venture capital in Asia, you must first understand what’s happening in China, which has long been one of the most popular markets in the world for foreign VC investors. The late 1990s and early 2000s were a time of incredible opportunity for these investors as Western-educated Chinese entrepreneurs lined up a capital pipeline to boost innovation in the technology sector, ultimately building some of the country\’s most formidable tech giants.The early success stories of Japan-based SoftBank investing in Alibaba and South Africa-based Naspers investing in Tencent have since attracted more foreign VC investors looking for the next big bet, and the market continues to thrive in its maturity.As early, foreign VC-backed tech companies gradually grew into the giants we know today, they also changed the competitive landscape of many industries in China—including the VC market itself.China-based tech giants are now focused on building super apps. And rather than developing new products in-house, they’re instead leveraging their hefty wallets and using mergers and acquisitions to expand. This opportunistic investment strategy is now disrupting the venture investment market in the country that VC firms once dominated. Foreign Investors Face New Obstacles For their part, many smaller and early-stage tech companies in China have come to prefer the financial backing of domestic tech partners to funds from foreign VC firms. This kind of partnership is effectively a trusted brand\’s stamp of approval for the company’s business model and thus attracts user traffic. The inclusion of the target firm\’s product offerings in the acquiring firm\’s broader app ecosystem also sweetens the position, as partnership opportunities increase from the additional visibility.',

        'Digital Ledgers vs. Databases: Can Blockchain Optimize Your Supply Chain?',
    text:
        'No tool is inherently good or bad. When it comes to blockchain, it’s crucial to distinguish between the speculative crypto markets that the technology enables and the business solutions that its underlying digital ledger architecture makes possible. In this article, I’ll explain how enterprise-grade applications developed using blockchain’s distributed ledger structure can provide a more efficient, transparent, and secure way for businesses to manage data as an asset, mitigate operational risks, cut costs, and even resolve supply chain issues.Cryptocurrency markets may now seem like the epitome of risk, with volatile prices, Ponzi schemes, and the persistent hacking and heists of digital assets including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But blockchain is a robust innovation that provides the operating framework for numerous information management platforms used in industries from financial services to healthcare. Indeed, as early as 2018, McKinsey & Company noted that blockchain\’s greatest short-term value was as a means to increase productivity in business processes. And other sources, such as Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, have continued to attest to its potential in this area.Blockchain applications hold particular promise for logistics—an area ripe for digital transformation. The supply chain crisis of 2021-22 highlighted the growing complexity of the global movement of goods as producers, shippers, logistics experts, and delivery companies struggled to communicate in a timely manner and provide end-to-end visibility. Yet customer expectations for transparency, dependability, and service continue to increase. I\’ve been working as a digital strategist for more than two decades, advising companies on using technology to transform their business models, operations, and customer experiences, and I believe that blockchain technology can help solve many of these problems.Why Use Blockchain for Supply Chain Management? To meet today\’s supply chain challenges, a company needs to bring all of its disparate logistical data and processes onto a single platform where the information can be aggregated, analyzed, validated, and displayed as orders are processed, inventory is prepared and packaged, and items are dispatched. The more granular, integrated, and comprehensive these platforms, the greater the efficiency and cost savings they can generate.For most firms, that has historically meant investing in database management systems, which use powerful software applications and advanced cloud-based computing solutions that analyze and integrate large sets of data with millions of records. But there are limits to how efficiently and dependably a database can manage and share so much detailed information. Companies that use the most advanced cloud-based database solutions must often still rely on analog tools like telephones, printers, and fax machines to ensure that every node in their complex global supply chain is connected. Latency and errors are commonplace and largely accepted.Blockchain isn\’t subject to these shortcomings. At its core, blockchain is a decentralized information management system. It\’s like a database, but as I\’ll explain shortly, it\’s structured differently and equipped with distinct functions. Blockchain’s digital ledger technology delivers a level of granularity and certitude that more traditional solutions can’t. And because all the data is controlled transparently across a distributed network, collaboration and trust come more easily.Blockchain vs. Databases: Understanding Key Features To clarify why and when blockchain can be better than conventional databases, let\’s take a closer look at some of its most powerful and distinctive features.Transparency: Databases use a client-server architecture, storing information organized in tables and files in a central logical server and granting users limited access to create, read, update, or delete it. By contrast, blockchain runs on a decentralized digital ledger network protocol, using digital “blocks” that can be thought of as pages in a ledger. In a public blockchain, all participants can see all the same information at the same time; in a private one, the information is typically segmented to meet the needs of multiple customers on the platform.In both types of blockchain, data is distributed across multiple nodes instead of housed centrally like in a traditional database. Most newer databases are cloud-based and they, too, can distribute data across more than one node, but someone has to manually create each additional node. In blockchain, node creation is inherent in the network formation and thus more seamless.Traceability: Blockchain stores data in an append-only structure in which new blocks are cryptographically linked to existing ones in chronological order. This naturally creates an audit trail. Saving hash values in a timestamped block enables a user to prove that a document existed at a certain time in a certain version and verify who created and was involved in each transaction. For example, Singapore-based startup LogChain, where I have served as a board advisor since 2020, helps chemical companies reengineer their supply chains, using blockchain to create records to track each container of potentially dangerous substances at every step of its journey.*Security and Immutability*: The information in a blockchain can\’t be altered or deleted unless all parties agree upon the changes. This creates an unchangeable record that\’s extraordinarily difficult to overwrite, falsify, or reverse. It also means that the record is encrypted end-to-end in the network, providing greater security against fraud and unauthorized activity than a database. That\’s why a logistics platform built on blockchain is powerful for establishing a product\’s provenance and tracking its journey through a complex global supply chain, especially when it comes to satisfying standards for ethical or sustainable sourcing or passing enhanced customs inspections.Efficiency and Automation: Blockchain\’s structure–managing a single distributed ledger collectively through a network of computers–eliminates the need for a central administrator and creates potential efficiencies. There\’s no need to reconcile multiple databases in different locations around the globe, so clearing and settlement of, say, financial instruments can be much faster. Certain transactions, like insurance payouts, can also be automated by embedding smart contracts into an application.',

      text:
          'You’re about to start a business in the US. You have a great idea and a winning team. You’ve thought through your business plan. You’re ready to make it official—but before you can begin, you have to decide what kind of business entity makes the most sense for your new company. There are several types of business entities and the one you choose determines how your business is regulated and taxed. Your choice of entity fundamentally boils down to a few key considerations: How profits are taxed? The complexity and cost of setting up the business, as well as ongoing governance and administration. Liability protection, particularly of an owner\’s personal assets. While in some cases the choice can be obvious, it isn\’t always. Each entity type offers a unique blend of legal and tax implications, and figuring out what\’s right for a specific business can be complicated.With more than 20 years of experience in accounting—including more than 14 years of providing CFO services to companies across multiple industries—I have advised numerous C corporations, S corporations, LLCs, and partnerships on tax and entity-choice matters. In this article, I’ll present the crucial points to keep in mind when you need to make this decision.Note: This is a top-level guide and certain details may not apply to your specific business. Any final decisions should be made with the help of a tax or legal advisor. A diagram displays the four structures: C corp and the three pass-through entities of proprietorship, partnership, and S corp. It also shows the optional LLC as an umbrella legal structure for all four. Understanding the Different Types of Business Entities, The IRS recognizes four main types of business entities: proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, and C corporation. These types have major differences when it comes to taxes, setup costs, administrative costs, and legal protections, but any of them can be formed as an LLC for liability assurance, then taxed as if they were one of the entity types recognized by the IRS.Before we dive into the business entity types or discuss LLCs, however, it\’s important to understand pass-through entities.What Are Pass-through Entities? Proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations are all pass-through entities. They are called that because their taxable income “passes through” to the personal tax returns of the owners and is taxed there.S corporations and partnerships do file company tax returns, but these returns simply display the company’s taxable income and allocate that income to the owners on a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). Each owner’s Schedule K-1 amount is then reported and taxed on their personal tax return—Form 1040—as well as on any state and local returns that may apply.In contrast, sole proprietorships don\’t file a business tax return at all. The business income is calculated directly on Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F of the owne\r’s personal Form 1040.Pass-through status is significant because the owners of a pass-through entity pay personal income tax on the profits of the company, but they can then withdraw those profits as tax-free dividends from the company. This is not true of C corporations, which not only pay their own income tax but also hold taxable dividends. Essentially, the C corporation pays tax on its income first, and the remaining money is distributed to the stockholders, who pay personal income tax on it. This is referred to as double taxation.',

      title: 'Why Your Startup Pitch Needs Sensitivity Analysis',
      text:
          'It takes more than an all-star team, a product with a competitive advantage, and a sizable potential market to guarantee fundraising success for your startup. With thousands of proposals flooding investors’ inboxes each year, and venture capital facing an uncertain future, it’s crucial that you distinguish your startup by showing your deep, realistic understanding of the impact even small changes can have on performance. The key is to include sensitivity analysis in your pitch.As an FP&A specialist who has supported multiple successful eight- and nine-figure fundraising efforts through financial modeling and pitch deck development, I’ve learned firsthand the nuances that separate founders who get funding from those who leave the table empty-handed. To present a convincing case, founders must show that they’re effectively balancing risk and responsibility by demonstrating that they have thoroughly evaluated the consequences of every decision.While it\’s understandable that founders want to project optimism when they’re pitching investors, ignoring challenges can damage the trust they need to build with potential funders. Venture capital firms are quickly turned off by implausibly positive financial forecast assumptions, such as overly generous market share predictions or unrealistic unit economics. What they want to see are model assumptions that have been tested and validated.That\’s especially important when capital is scarce. In 2023, raising money has been particularly tough for startups, with global funding diving to \$76 billion in the first quarter, a 53% decrease from the \$162 billion recorded in the same quarter of 2022, according to Crunchbase. What’s more, in the same period, every funding stage experienced a steep decline of around 44% to 54%. These figures suggest that venture capital firms are growing more risk-averse. The best response to this trend is to exhibit strong fundamentals and provide persuasive evidence of viability through sensitivity analysis.What Is Sensitivity Analysis? Sensitivity analysis, also called what-if analysis, measures the effects of changing inputs in a mathematical model. In a financial model, sensitivity analysis can reveal the inputs with the greatest impact on a business, and help managers develop KPIs and strategies to monitor and address changes in those areas of the business. For instance, if variables such as market size, unit cost, price, or sales volume were to change, how might that affect financial performance—and which one has the biggest impact?In my experience, founders can sometimes confuse sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. While both practices evaluate the impact of changes on business models, they’re not the same.Sensitivity analysis typically focuses on the one or two most important variables in a business model—that is, the ones that will generally cause the largest degree of change, depending on the industry and how the model is built. For example, you might want to sensitize sales price per square foot in a real estate development model, customer churn rates in a subscription-based model, or product mix in a manufacturing model.Scenario analysis, on the other hand, is used to measure how businesses perform with variations in macro factors that influence the whole organization or an entire business unit. Scenario analysis would be appropriate for evaluating the probable impact of a recession or changing industry regulations—two situations that have a significant effect on a company’s performance even if some key variables and assumptions remain the same.Sensitivity analysis is one of the most helpful ways a founder can calm investors\’ nerves, because it provides them with a view of the margin of safety associated with their investments. If an investor is using a minimum internal rate of return (IRR) as one of their investment qualification metrics, for example, sensitivity analysis can easily demonstrate how significantly the forecasted performance would need to change before the investment fell below the minimum IRR.From an investor\’s perspective, knowing that an investment can still achieve the minimum IRR over the life of the investment despite a 10% drop in sales volume, for instance, gives additional credibility to the founder, the model, and the management team. In this case, even if a prospective investor disagrees with some of the growth prospects and assumes sales will be only 95% of the forecast, they can know that the investment is still a viable one.Now let\’s take a deeper look at the many things sensitivity analysis can help you do to impress potential investors—and benefit your company.',
